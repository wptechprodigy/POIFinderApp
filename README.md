# POI Finder App

## Overview
This app allows users to find nearby points of interest using Apple Maps and save their favorite locations for offline access.

## How to Run the App
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wptechprodigy/POIFinderApp.git`
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or physical device.

## Assumptions
- Users have access to location services.
- The app focuses on restaurants as the default category for nearby searches.

## Limitations
- Autocomplete suggestions are limited to the current region.
- Offline mode assumes previously saved locations are available.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional categories (e.g., cafes, gas stations).
- Implement advanced filtering and sorting for search results.
